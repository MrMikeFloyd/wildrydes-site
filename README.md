# WildRydes Demo Application

This repo contains the site contents for the unicorn taxi service 'WildRydes'. It is based on an [AWS tutorial on serverless applications](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito) and involves Lambda, Cognito, Amplify, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

This repository contains the front end part of the application that is hosted using AWS Amplify.

## How to reach the application

If I haven't torn the service down to save cost, it should be available at [unicorns.wildlife4life.de](https://unicorns.wildlife4life.de/).
